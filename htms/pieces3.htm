     <p><strong>This is a story from late in the life of Grandfather Mantis – so late that 
  black people, and perhaps even white people, had come to the lands of my ancestors. 
  We know that because it starts with sheep, which came with the black herdsmen. 
  These men brought their sheep in great flocks to eat the thin grass that sustained 
  all the animals Grandfather Mantis and his hunters loved – eland, springbok, 
  hartebeest. Mantis saw these sheep and recognized that they were a new kind 
  of animal. He hunted them, and was both pleased and worried that they were so 
  easy to kill – there was something wrong about creatures that waited so passively 
  for their deaths. But when he had shot two with his arrows, the black men who 
  owned them came upon him. The men were as numerous as ants, and they beat him. 
  At last he pulled his cloak of hartebeest hide around him, so that his magic 
  blinded them, and made his escape. Although he was able to take the two sheep 
  he had killed, the herders had beaten him badly. By the time he had limped back 
  to his camp, his kraal, he was so tired and sore and bloody that he felt himself 
  to be dying. Mantis told his family, "I am unwell – they have killed me, those 
  men who are not the First People." And he cursed the newcomers, saying "My word 
  upon them. They shall lose their fire, and they shall lose their sheep, and 
  they will live only like ticks, on uncooked food." But still he was unwell, 
  and felt that the world had become a place of darkness. He felt it to be true 
  that there was no more room for the First People. He called his family before 
  him, his wife Rock-Rabbit, his son Rainbow, his beloved daughter-in-law Porcupine, 
  and their two sons, the grandsons of Mantis, who were named Moongoose and Younger 
  Rainbow. Porcupine, with her great heart and sympathetic eye, was the first 
  to see that something was very wrong with her father-in-law. Neither did she 
  like the sheep, which were strange to her. "Look," she said to her husband, 
  Rainbow, "look at the creatures your father has brought back."<br>
But Mantis told them all to be quiet, and said. "I am weak with pain, and my throat is swollen so that I cannot speak proper words or eat those sheep. Porcupine, you must go to your father, the one called the All-Devourer, and tell him to come and help me eat up these sheep."<br>
  Porcupine was fearful and said, "No, Grandfather, for when the All-Devourer 
  comes, there will be nothing left for anyone. He will leave nothing behind under 
  the sky."<br>
Mantis was stubborn. "Go to the old man yonder, the All-Devourer, and tell him to come that he may help me eat these sheep. I feel that my heart is upset, so that I want the old man yonder to come. When he comes, I will once more be able to talk properly, for my throat is swollen now and I cannot talk in the way that I should. Let us lay out the sheep and welcome your father."<br>
  Porcupine said, " You do not want that old man to come here. Let me give you 
  some springbok meat, so you can fill your belly."<br>
  Mantis shook his head. " That meat is white with age. I will eat these sheep 
  – this new meat – but you must tell your father to come and help me."Porcupine 
  was sad, and full of a great fear, for Mantis had never before been so sick 
  and so unhappy, and something terrible was bound to happen. " I will go to fetch 
  him, and tomorrow he will come. Then you will see him for yourself, that terrible 
  old man, with your own eyes."<br>
  Mantis was satisfied with this and fell asleep, but still he cried out in his 
  pain even as he slept. Porcupine told her sons Younger Rainbow and Moongoose 
  to take the springbok meat away and hide it, and to take their father Rainbow´s 
  spear and hide that as well. Then she set out on her journey.<br>
  As she traveled, she looked on everything she passed with the eye of her heart, 
  and said to herself, "Tomorrow this thing will be gone. Tomorrow that thing 
  will be gone." When she reached the place where her father lived, she could 
  not face him, but from a distance shouted out: "Mantis, your cousin, bids you 
  to come and help eat up the sheep, for his heart is troubled." Then she hurried 
  back to her family at the kraal of Grandfather Mantis.<br>
Mantis asked her, "Where is your father?"<br>
  Porcupine said, "He is still on the way. Look at that bush, standing above us, 
  to see if a shadow comes gliding from on high."<br>
Mantis looked but saw nothing.<br>
Porcupine said, "Watch for the bush to break off. Then when you see that all the bushes up there have disappeared, look for the shadow. For his tongue will take away all the bushes, even before he has come up from behind the hill. Then will his body come up, and all the bushes around us will be devoured, and we will no longer be hidden."<br>
  Mantis replied, "I still see nothing." Now he, too, was frightened, but he had 
  invited the All-Devourer, and the All-Devourer was coming.<br>
  Porcupine said, "You will see a tongue of fire in the darkness, for all that 
  stands before him he destroys, and his mouth engulfs everything." And she went 
  away then and took back the springbok meat that had been hidden and gave it 
  to her two young sons, that they should be strong for what lay ahead.<br>
  And as Grandfather Mantis sat waiting, a great, great shadow fell upon him. 
  He cried out to Porcupine, "Oh, daughter, why is it so dark when there are no 
  clouds in the sky?" For in that moment he felt what he had done, and he was 
  very afraid.<br>
  The All-Devourer said in his terrible hollow voice, "I have been invited. Now 
  you must feed me." And he sat down in Mantis´ camp and began to eat everything, 
  for within the great mouth, in the heart of the shadow, there was a tongue of 
  fire. First he ate the sheep, and chewed their bones, and swallowed their fleeces. 
  When he was done, he ate all the other meat, and the tsama melons, and the roots, 
  and every seed and flower and leaf. Then he devoured the shelters and the digging 
  sticks, the trees and even the stones of the earth. When he swallowed down Rainbow, 
  the son of Mantis, Porcupine took their two Children and ran away. As they escaped, 
  the All-Devourer swallowed down Mantis´ wife, Rock-Rabbit, and then even Grandfather 
  Mantis himself disappeared into the stomach that now stretched from horizon 
  to horizon.<br>
  Porcupine took the spear which her sons had hidden and heated it in the fire 
  until it glowed, then she tested her sons to make sure that they would be fit 
  for what lay ahead. She touched Younger Rainbow and Moongoose with the hot spearpoint, 
  pressing it on their foreheads, their eyes, their noses and ears, to make sure 
  they would be brave enough to see and understand the way ahead. The eyes of 
  Moongoose filled with tears, and she said "You are the mild one – you will sit 
  on my father´s left hand." But the eyes of Younger Rainbow only grew drier the 
  more she burned him, and she said, "You are the fierce one, you will sit on 
  my father´s right hand." Then she took them back to the fire and they seated 
  themselves on either side of the All-Devourer, who was still hungry, although 
  he had eaten nearly everything under the sky. In a moment he would eat them 
  up, too, but instead the two brothers grabbed his arms and pulled him back, 
  dragging him down to the ground. As they held him, fighting against his great 
  strength, and while the tongue of flame in his black mouth was burning them, 
  Younger Rainbow took his father´s spear, and at his mother Porcupine´s bidding, 
  sliced open the stomach of the All-Devourer. He and Moongoose pulled the stomach 
  wide open, and everything that the All-Devourer had eaten up came rushing out 
  in a flood– meat and roots and trees and bushes and people. Even Grandfather 
  Mantis came out at last, changed and silent. Porcupine said, "I feel that everything 
  has changed. Now is the time when we must go away and find a new place. We will 
  leave my father the All-Devourer her, lying in the kraal. We will go far away. 
  We will find a new place." And she led her father-in-law and all her family 
  away, out of the world and into a new place, where they still live.<br/>

  <div class="story"><strong>It is a good story, one of my people´s favorites<br/>
  It is about Beetle and Striped Mouse. Beetle was a very beautiful young woman. 
  All the young men would have tried to make her their own, but her father Lizard 
  was a sour old man and did not want his daughter to leave him. He put her in 
  his house, a hole deep under the earth, and would not let her out into the sunlight. 
  He would let no man court her. All of the First People went to Grandfather Mantis 
  to complain, saying that it was unfair for old Lizard to keep a lovely young 
  woman like Beetle hidden away so that none of their sons could marry her and 
  her beauty was not shared. Grandfather Mantis sent them away, saying he must 
  consider what they said.<br>
That night, Mantis had a dream. He dreamed that Lizard had taken the moon down into his hole in the earth as well, and that without it in the night sky, the First People were lost and terrified. When he awakened, he decided that he could not allow Lizard to hide his daughter away.<br>
  Mantis sent for Long-Nosed Mouse, who was a beautiful fellow, and told him what 
  had happened. „It is for you to find the place she is hidden,"Grandfather Mantis 
  said. Long-Nosed Mouse was one of the best of all the First People at finding 
  things, so he agreed, and went in search of Lizard´s daughter. When at last 
  Long-Nosed Mouse came near the hole in the earth, Beetle saw him. In her excitement, 
  she could not help herself. She called out, „Look, look, a man is coming!"Her 
  father heard this cry, and when Long-Nosed Mouse entered into the earth, Lizard 
  fell upon him in the dark and killed him.„Who shall tell a father what he may 
  and may not do?"said Lizard. He was so proud and happy he did dance. Beetle 
  wept. When Mantis heard what had happened he was sad and afraid. The kinsmen 
  of Long-Nosed Mouse heard also, and one by one they went down into Lizard ´s 
  hole to avenge their brother, but Lizard lay hidden until each one was lost 
  in the dark tunnels, then fell upon him and killed him. Soon all the men of 
  the long-nosed mice had been slain. Their wives and children set up a great 
  cry of mourning so loud that it pained Grandfather Mantis, so loud that he could 
  not sleep for three days.<br>
  When at last he fell asleep, he had another dream, and when he awakened from 
  it he called all his people together. „In my dream I have seen Lizard killing 
  the long-nosed mice, and that is something that cannot be. In my dream I have 
  spoken to myself, and I have thought much, and I find that it is the Striped 
  Mouse who must now go and save the young woman, Beetle."Striped Mouse was young, 
  quiet, and clever, and he knew that the dreams of Mantis could not be ignored. 
  „I will go", he said and set out. But when he came to the place where Lizard 
  lived, and where so many had fallen before him, Striped Mouse thought, „Why 
  should I go down that hole in the dark, when I know Lizard is waiting will dig 
  a hole of my own." And so he did, scratching his way into the earth, for the 
  Striped Mouse is a good digger, until he came at last into the tunnel in where 
  Lizard lay in wait. But because he had been quiet and clever, Striped Mouse 
  had dug his own hole in behind the place where Lizard was, and so he was able 
  to fall upon Lizard from behind. Long they fought, until Striped Mouse at last 
  began to win out. Lizard shouted in fear and unhappiness, „Why do you kill me? 
  Why do you raise your hand against me?"„I am by myself, killing to save friends,"cried 
  Striped Mouse, and with that Lizard fell dead before him. Striped Mouse found 
  Beetle, and although she was frightened he led her forth out of the hole and 
  into the light. As he did that, a wonderful thing happened, for all the long-nosed 
  mice who had fallen came back to life, crying „I am here!"Each stepped out into 
  the sunlight behind Striped Mouse and Beetle, each one carrying a fly-whisk, 
  which he lifted over his head like a flag. Striped Mouse was very proud as he 
  walked beside Beetle, and happiness was great inside both of them, because he 
  already felt himself to be the husband of the young woman, and she felt herself 
  to be his utterly. When they reached Mantis, he got up and followed them. As 
  they came to the village where the long-nosed mice had lived, waving their fly-whisks, 
  the grass of the plain began to wave, too. All the wives and the children of 
  the long-nosed mice came rushing out, making glad cries to see that their men 
  were alive again, and Grandfather Mantis watched with amazement and joy, not 
  a little surprised by how well he had dreamed.</strong></div>
