    <b>Demon Dream</b></p>
<p><b> Once I spent some time far away in the north. A legendary country in which 
  the ancient druids are said to have celebrated their secret rites. But these 
  dark ages are long gone, as I thought. I stayed with some old friends of the 
  family in a small town. At this time I didn´t feel too well. The world didn´t 
  seem very attractive to me. In my sleep my dreams were troublesome &amp; when 
  I was awake I didn´t feel in tune with the flow of everyday life. At daytime 
  I longed for a dreamful night &amp; at night I dreaded the coming long cruel 
  day. So I decided to take some time &amp; as you will read the events proved 
  me right. </b></p>
<p><b>As I had nothing else to do I often went for long walks exploring the country. 
  One day I strolled through the woods though I knew better as the villagers had 
  repeatedly warned me against it. They claimed that the forest was haunted. Strange 
  lights &amp; noises have been seen &amp; heard. Inhuman creatures were said 
  to live there. The stories of inexplicable things happening were plenty. But 
  I sneered at all this superstitious crap. We live in a modern age so why heed 
  such foolish warnings. At least I thought them foolish. </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>After hours of nature´s beauty I came upon an odd circular 
  clearing where everything seemed peaceful &amp; quiet. It was a nice day &amp; 
  I was a little exhausted so I decided to rest some time. I lay down in the opening 
  &amp; the afternoon sun. It didn´t take me long &amp; my eyelids felt heavy 
  &amp; I couldn´t stay awake anymore. Before I was lost in a dreamless sleep 
  it briefly struck me that the clearing lay in a perfect ring of odd-shaped stones 
  &amp; toadstools. But then my thoughts were already too confused to make anything 
  of it...</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Hours later I woke up &amp; it was already dark. I looked 
  up at the sky. The moon was full. I began to feel uncomfortable as I had to 
  think about the superstitious locals who´d told me repeatedly that strange things 
  used to happen in these &quot;mystical&quot; woods. Then I remembered that I 
  was standing in a circle of stones &amp; toadstools &amp; isn´t there a story 
  to those rings ? I decided that it was high time to take a fast exit &amp; get 
  out of this forest. But as soon as I got near the edge of the circle the stones 
  emitted a strange green light &amp; I could hear a faint chanting. I had to 
  slap myself to see if I was by chance still asleep &amp; only dreaming. But 
  the pain only stung &amp; the light just shone brighter. Suddenly there were 
  small dark spots in the light which drew closer to me. I could make out that 
  these were some kind of creatures which looked like faerïes. Faerïes ??!! You 
  know very small naked people with wings who are often mentioned in old tales, 
  songs &amp; legends. &amp; I always thought they were just this - legends. Obviously 
  they were real - or me just a nutcase. They flew gracefully around me &amp; 
  I overheard them speaking about me in their delicate thin voices. I was astonished 
  &amp; just stood there watching these beautiful entities.</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Then they disappeared all but one. She was obviously a female 
  specimen &amp; quite a beauty. She seemed slightly bigger as the others &amp; 
  she had an air about her that demanded unshared attention. She hovered on eye-level 
  with me &amp; began to speak : </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;Human fool! How dare you intrude our peaceful forest? 
  Aren´t you satisfied destroying the world outside? Must you bring your human 
  destructiveness even here? Are you willing to take this place as well ?&quot; 
  </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;I ... I didn´t mean to disturb you &amp; I regret 
  deeply what my people did to our home. In trying to escape &amp; to find a little 
  peace I came here. I humbly apologize my intruding. There was no ill intended.&quot; 
  </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;Mortal, I know you very well &amp; this was just a 
  little test. To see if you changed in these past ages.&quot; </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;Now wait a minute! Do I have this right? You know 
  me? Ages? May I ask you what you are talking about?&quot; &quot;Listen! Know 
  that I´m the Queen of the faerïes &amp; thus knew a long time ago that you would 
  eventually be lead to this place again. In ancient times it was decided to grant 
  you a wish if you are able to answer a simple question.&quot; </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;Again? Never before in my life was I here. How do 
  I deserve a wish? I´m no one special, just a ...&quot; </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;You are far more. You always were. A friend of my 
  people. In every life you helped us with your magic &amp; now we are going to 
  give you what your heart desires.&quot; </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;Magic? I know nothing of magic &amp; I certainly don´t 
  believe in reincarnation ... But I also don´t believe in faerïes. &amp; now 
  I´m standing here in green light, arguing with the very Queen of the faerïes. 
  It´s more probable that I drank to much in the tavern &amp; I just dream this.&quot; 
  </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;´Tis no dream &amp; let me assure you in former lifes 
  you were quite a magician. But now enough of this foolish talk. I know you, 
  rest assured. Never could I mistake your bright burning light for someone else´s. 
  Listen! I´ll ask you now a question that will change your life. Name the five 
  elements ancient mages knew to master.&quot;</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;That´s easy. It´s fire, water, earth. air &amp; ...&quot; 
  </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>A fifth element? I never before heard of another element. 
  What the ... was she talking about anyway. Me a magician! Ha! Who was the crazy 
  person here? What element...</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>As I strenuous thought about magic &amp; a fifth element 
  something deep in me stirred. Ancient knowledge flooded my consciousness but 
  it was gone before I could really grasp it. But could clearly see the truth 
  in her words &amp; most importantly, I knew the answer to her little quiz.</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;It´s ether!&quot;</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;Congratulations, I had my doubts you could remember 
  these very old lessons but you did it. Now think of your deepest desire. Name 
  it &amp; your wish shall be granted.&quot; </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>At least once in life everybody has had thoughts about what 
  one would wish for given the opportunity. But actually having to decide I couldn´t 
  think of anything. I pondered on this for what seemed to be an eternity. &amp; 
  the faerïe just gave me a patient smile &amp; didn´t press me all. A long time 
  later I knew what to wish for. </b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;You know I have this dream that haunts me. At first 
  it was quite harmless but now it´s very disturbing &amp; everybody I tell this 
  dream thinks me mad. I will tell you the whole story. Years ago in one of my 
  dreams I came upon a big wall. The height of it you can´t even begin to imagine. 
  I became curious what would lie behind this wall &amp; I spent many a night 
  looking for a way to the other side. One night dreaming I found a big, wooden, 
  ancient-looking door. I was happy but that lasted only for a moment as I found 
  the door locked. Desperation overwhelmed me. I hammered against it but naturally 
  it wouldn´t budge. ´T was far too massive. I tried looking through the keyhole 
  but all I could see was darkness. After this failure I tried to forget about 
  that wall. But often in my dreams I found myself standing before this door trying 
  to open it. So eventually I started looking for a key. Years passed in real 
  life &amp; in my dreams I kept on looking for the key. I found many but none 
  ever fitted. Finally one day I discovered what I did wrong. I only searched 
  in my dreams but wasn´t it possible that it´s actually a real, solid key? So 
  I started to spend my waking hours searching as well. &amp; at least I found 
  it. Ironically it was in possession of my very family. My great-grandfather 
  got it as an gift form a gipsy he saved from drowning. He passed it on to his 
  son when he died &amp; so did my grandfather. &amp; when my father died I was 
  the one to get it. The key was very old looking &amp; solid gold &amp; from 
  the first moment I held it in my hand I knew it to be the very key. So the next 
  night I went to bed with the key hanging around my neck. &amp; in my dream I 
  found myself still wearing it. What is there left to say. It did open the door. 
  But after all these years I hesitated to step through it. Then with all my courage 
  I did it. I took a deep breath &amp; the last steps.</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>And what joy. I seemed to be standing in another reality. 
  It was like waking up though it wasn´t the world I knew. The air smelled fresh 
  of nature, strong scents of blossoming flowers &amp; everything was green. I 
  know this sounds stupid but you of all people should be able to understand it.</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>There was no one in sight , at first. Then I saw a dark 
  spot in the sky. It seemed to be moving &amp; soon I recognized it to be a winged 
  creature. But don´t think this being looked anything like you as when it drew 
  nearer it frightenly looked more &amp; more like a creature out of hell. As 
  big as me with black leathery wings. Her skin black as the night she looked 
  as if she came straight from hell. Then she landed right before me &amp; suddenly 
  she didn´t frighten me anymore. Quite the opposite. She was gorgeous. This fallen 
  angel. Love at first sight. She was a dark-dweller no use denying it but her 
  beauty enchanted me. With an inhuman grace she came very close to me. Her red 
  hair was in beautiful contrast to her black wings. She looked me straight in 
  the eyes. Impossible to describe this pair. Their colour was purple with golden 
  spots but that is really an insufficient description of their fineness. Without 
  saying one word this She-devil kissed &amp; embraced me. Our bodies unconsciously 
  swayed to the shrill, faint piping of the oldest music, a rhythm of wind &amp; 
  water. A tune so very deep &amp; intimate. I felt like I never felt before. 
  I knew at once that with her I´m whole, complete. No one but her ...</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>And just as I thought this moment would last forever my 
  alarm clock rang &amp; I was forced through the ominous door &amp; woke up. 
  &amp; this is how it goes. In some dreams I can´t even find my way to the door 
  but when I find it sooner or later meet her as well. I always have to wake up 
  &amp; the time with her always seems much too short. &amp; there´s my wish. 
  Let me sleep here protected by the stones &amp; toadstools &amp; never ever 
  let me wake up again. I´d rather spend my life in this dream with my fair dark-dweller 
  than here in this gray world in which everyday is just an endless struggle to 
  survive.&quot;</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>&quot;You spoke like I expected you to. Thy wish shall be 
  granted. Protected in this magic circle you´ll sleep eternally ´till Armageddon 
  wipes everything away.&quot;</b></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>She motioned me to lie down &amp; as I did she made some 
  gestures &amp; chanted words I never herd before. Almost at once I was standing 
  in front of the door to the mysterious land. Without hesitation I stepped through 
  into a new life...</b></p>
<p align="RIGHT"><b>G.I.G. D.R.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The way to the demon and beyond:</b></p>
<p><b><br>
  Da bist Du ja wieder, meine Dämonin. Du sitzt mir gegenüber, schaust mich mit 
  Deinen schönen, verführerischen Augen an. Deine tiefschwarzen Schwingen faszinieren 
  mich. Erinnere Dich daran, als wir uns zum ersten Male sahen. Damals in Kaddath, 
  der Welt, die jenseits unserer Träume liegt. Du bist Durch die Lüfte geflogen 
  &amp; dann in meiner Nähe gelandet. Sofort war es um mich geschehen. Deine graziöse 
  Landung, Dein schwingender, aufreizender Gang, Dein schöner Körper, Dein wildes 
  rotes Haar ... Wir kennen uns seit Anbeginn der Zeit &amp; doch erst seit kurzem, 
  vielleicht begegnen wir uns auch morgen zum ersten Mal. Wir tanzen zusammen 
  durch dieses Land, daß wir nur in unserem Schlaf erleben. Ich weiß noch, als 
  ich den Schlüssel fand. Golden war er &amp; schloß die Türe in der Mauer auf. 
  Jede Nacht fragte ich mich, was wohl die unbezwingbare Wand verbirgt. Die offene 
  Türe zeigte mir dann diese Welt, von der ich Nacht für Nacht vermutete, daß 
  es sie gibt, aber nie fand. Aber jetzt, da ich es gefunden habe, fand ich dort 
  auch Dich, meine kleine Teufelin. Ich weiß nicht, wo Du herkommst, auch nicht, 
  ob Du überhaupt von meiner Ebene stammst, doch immer wieder treffe ich Dich. 
  Vielleicht stammen wir auch von hier, diesem Land &amp; immer wenn wir schlafen 
  gehen, &quot;wachen&quot; wir in der &quot;Realität&quot; auf. Aber andererseits, 
  warum sollten wir denn nur Nachtmahre erleben. Warte, geh noch nicht, hörst 
  Du denn nicht diese Musik, durchdringt sie Dich nicht? Komm her zu mir, flieg 
  mit mir in diese Musik. Nimm mich ....<br>
  </b></p>
<p><b><strong>/// </strong></b></p>
<p><b>I woke up. I was in a train compartment but I didn´t know how I got there. 
  Next to me sat a woman &amp; I asked her where we were driving to. She laughed 
  but said nothing. It was a dirty, mean laugh. Her eyes didn´t laugh, they seemed 
  to be dead... The man in front of me looked bemused. I tried him but again got 
  no Answer. Just a queer look. Got pissed &amp; got up. Went out of the compartment 
  into the aisle to look for someone else to answer me. But there wasn´t anybody. 
  So I went down &amp; looked into the compartments. The people in there just 
  looked straight ahead. Nobody spoke to me or to anybody else. It was creepy. 
  By then I wasn´t annoyed anymore. I was a little frightened. I tried to get 
  into the next wagon, but the connecting doors wouldn´t open. So I looked out 
  of the windows, in hope to see something familiar, but you couldn´t see far 
  - only morning fog. At least I supposed it was morning. I tried to open all 
  the windows but none moved just like the connecting doors. I was frustrated 
  but as I didn´t have anything else to do I went back into the compartment I 
  woke up in earlier. This time the others didn´t even take notice of me. I didn´t 
  know how long I waited but finally the train stopped. I hurried to the doors 
  in hope to be able to get out but again the doors wouldn´t open. But I could 
  see where we were. It came as a shock. I knew this place. I hadn´t been there 
  before but I knew it to be situated in Kaddath. But that couldn´t be. I knew 
  that Kaddath did not exist. Only beyond my dreams could I visit this country 
  &amp; that just didn´t feel like a dream. Then I tried to remember what I did 
  before I went to sleep, what the last thing was I could remember. At that point 
  it occurred to me that I couldn´t remember anything from before. I didn´t even 
  know my name. Vaguely I remembered a female demon (a very beautiful one), strange 
  music, &amp; kissing that winged demon. Although I couldn´t recall much about 
  her I started to worry where she was. If anything had happened to my fallen 
  angel. Why was I alone in this train with these strange people? And why could 
  I only remember that kiss with her ? Then the train got rolling again &amp; 
  it didn´t stop up to now. Infinite...</b></p>
<p><b><br>
  /// </b></p>
<p><b>My demon, come and get me. Free me from this never ending nightmare. Don´t 
  you long for our special time? I despair in this train bound for nowhere. Where 
  are you my winged one?<br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>///</b></p>
<p><b>Do you remember? Do you remember the first time we met? Do you remember 
  when there was you &amp; me? We haven´t seen in ages. The earth was still young 
  and we had dreams. Music was in our minds and we knew that as long as we heard 
  this tune ... Your black wings ... I miss you!<br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>///</b></p>
<p><b>There you are, my love! Where have you been? Thought you were gone for good. 
  No, please don´t say nothing. Just take me in your arms and spread your dark 
  wings. Let´s fly away. You know, to this special place, where you and me are 
  going to be one item. The place the music always plays... Kiss me ! Please ! 
  I waited far too long. Burn me with your kiss &amp; take my breath away. I´m 
  longing for your touch. Make me whole again. Let´s celebrate the moment...<br>
  </b></p>
<p><b>///</b></p>
<p><b> You are standing there. I see your back, your black wings folded in. Why 
  did you turn away? I thought we were special. Don´t you remember the first time 
  we kissed? Tender and wild, cautious &amp; demanding, going back and forth, 
  aimlessly in the night? Our place where we danced the night away, arm in arm, 
  cheek to cheek? I guess you do not and I guess you don´t care anyway. So why 
  do you stand there? Just an arm´s length away, taunting me with what I once 
  got &amp; now will never ever get. It´s sad but true, in the end I´d rather 
  not see you ever again than ever feel this disappointment again. (Just let me 
  go)<br>
  Just unfold your leather wings and take off to wherever your wild heart takes 
  you. Do it now as long as there´s some piece of me still left. You know, those 
  wings of yours were what I think our undoing. Me, wingless one, I am just a 
  person of the earth. Grounded unless someone lifts me up. But you, you are a 
  creature living in both worlds, the earth and the air. You are unrestricted 
  and all independent. I relied on you to lift me up &amp; you did &amp; we both 
  loved it. But in the end I became more of a burden, restricting your freedom. 
  Now just get going, don´t mind me, I won´t keep you grounded anymore. I´d sure 
  like to, though. Just leave...</b></p>
