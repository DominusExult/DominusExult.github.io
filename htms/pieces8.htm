    <p class="Stil7"><u>The Princess and the Frog</u></p>
<p><strong>Once upon the time there was a beautiful 
  princess. Her name was Gladys or Norah or something like that.<br>
  Ever since she was just a very little girl her mother (The Queen) and her doting 
  father (The King) (they were Queen and King of Ruthenia or Ukrainia or one of 
  those other eastern European nations that later disappeared under the brutal 
  heel of Stalinist terror in his single-minded but misguided attempt to break 
  the backs of the bourgeois landlord class and forge the mighty industrial monolith 
  that the Soviet Union isn´t today.)<br>
Where was I? Ah, yes. Ever since she was, as I said before, just a very little girl, her mother and father had told her that appearances weren´t everything, and the chances were that one day she would meet a horrible warty frog and, merely by kissing him, he would reveal himself to be, in fact, a handsome prince and the love of her life.<br>
An unlikely story, admittedly, but back in those days before television and worldwide information technology and so forth, they believed all kinds of crazy things.<br>
And so off she went in search of her frog prince.<br>
Eventually, after wandering the length and breadth of the kingdom, she happened upon a pretty little pond and stopped to rest.<br>
To her great surprise, sitting on a medium-sized round stone half submerged in the water, was a horrible, ugly, warty frog.<br>
Actually, more often than not, it´s toads that are horrible and warty, but in this case it was a frog with a particularly nasty skin condition.<br>
Pausing only to wash her travel-weary hands and feet, grab a few hours´ well-earned sleep, change into one of her favorite evening gowns and attend to a few of the many mysterious details of feminine hygiene which baffle but enthrall us mere males, she closed her eyes, puckered up and ... kissed the frog.<br>
And when she opened her eyes, what do you think had happened? Nothing. The frog just stared back with its unblinking exophthalmic eyes.<br>
Now her mother said she was fickle, her father had always called her a flibbertigibbet and her brother, Prince Roger, said she was pathologically unable to commit to any meaningful relationship for various reasons, not the least of which being her eating disorders and drug abuse.<br>
But she decided to jolly well prove them all wrong, for she knew in her heart of hearts that deep within this repulsive creature lurked the handsomest prince and the light of her life and that an act of supreme devotion on her part would eventually reveal to her beauty beneath the ugliness.<br>
So by the bank of the pretty little pond she made her home, forsaking all comforts save for three square meals and a new gown brought daily from her father´s castle about a kilometer and a half away, which was .. what... something like just over a mile, I guess. (This being Europe, the country had gone metric some years ago.)<br>
Did I mention that she´d wandered round in a big circle to get here?<br>
At the dawning of each new day and once again just before bedtime she planted a kiss on the lips of the disgusting horrible warty frog.<br>
But he remained unchanged.<br>
The days stretched into weeks and the weeks stretched into months, but the beautiful princess repeated her ritual.<br>
  She was sure that only through a supreme act of devotion and love could she 
  save her prince from the spell that was upon him ... which she assumed had been 
  laid by the evil witch who happened to live in a sinister and crumbling house 
  close by, and who I should have mentioned earlier.<br>
  She knew that through her sheer constancy and single-mindedness she would prove wrong the bleatings and winnowings of her family, particularly her brother Prince Roger ... And anyway, what did he know about such things with his "business trips" and his "beer festivals!", his mistresses ... and with his wife ready to drop his third poor wretch of baby!<br>
And what he gets up to late with that jockey friend of his is anybody´s guess!!<br>
  The weeks stretched into months (did I already say that?) and the beautiful 
  princess remained true to her promise. (The one she´d made to herself about 
  sticking around.) But the handsome prince clung stubbornly to his amphibious 
  form.<br>
  Occasionally, it occurred to her that this whole situation was a bit ridiculous, 
  and that the very idea of witches and changing people into frogs etc. ran contrary 
  to all the known laws of Newtonian physics...<br>
But damn it all, she´d started, so she was jolly well going to see it through to the end.<br>
The months stretched into years and the years stretched into .. well, more years .. and eventually the beautiful princess grew old and died.<br>
Shortly after that the frog died, too.<br>
THE END<br>

<strong><br>
<u>The Prince and the Witch</u><br>
<br>
Once upon a time there was a handsome prince who happened to visit an ugly old witch while he was on his way to pay an impromptu visit to a beautiful princess who lived in a castle nearby.<br>
His name was Colin (you can tell I´m making these names up, can´t you?)<br>
He´d probably dropped in to buy a love potion or something.<br>
Anyway, he must have made an off-the-cuff remark of some sort because she was so annoyed about something (and you know how touchy witches can be sometimes) that she cast an evil spell on him ...<br>
... and turned him into a rock!<br>
(of medium size, and round)<br>
She said a rock he would remain until he received a kiss from a beautiful princess, or for that matter anyone. And without further ado she hurled him out of her window and he rolled down the slight incline and came to rest half submerged in the water of a pretty little pond.<br>
Soon after that a horrible warty frog crawled out of the pond and sat on him.<br>
