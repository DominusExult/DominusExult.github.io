    <p><strong>THE TIMES WEEKEND * Saturday August 8 1998 * feature * Page 21<br>
  By David Bowker<br>
  <font size="4">David Bowker was told by a fan to get a life, and enjoy it. But 
  this week´s challenge, to be happy, was too much. Only stupid people are happy</font><br>
  Recently, a Mr. K. Childs from Cheshire wrote to me, pointing out that I never 
  stop moaning. He said: "Although I enjoy reading about your weekly misadventures, 
  I hope for your sake that your real life isn´t as miserable as the life you 
  depict in your column." As a postscript Mr. Childs added: "Are you interested 
  in Doctor Who by any chance?"<br>
  Actually, Mar Childs, my life is purgatory. Not that it´s any of your business. 
  Since my childhood, numerous people have criticized me for being unduly negative. 
  The fact that these critics have included my friends and family, my psychiatrist 
  and everyone else who knows me, leads me to suspect that they may have a point.<br>
  It isn´t that I want to be miserable. I would willingly enjoy life if other 
  people weren´t always ruining it for me. Take your letter, for example. It´s 
  always nice to receive fan mail. I was cheered by the fact that you liked my 
  column. Then I read the comment about Doctor Who and realized you were a nutter. 
  Fan letters from nutters don´t count. But at least this particular nutter gave 
  me the idea for this week´s challenge: seven days trying to enjoy life.<br>
  On the enjoyment front, last Saturday looked promising. I went to a wedding. 
  Unlike most couples, the bride and groom liked each other. There was a good 
  chance that they would be together for at least three years before they divorced. 
  The ceremony was simple but moving. The bride´s veil all but covered her five 
  o´clock shadow and the groom had remembered to put his false teeth in.<br>
  When the vicar pronounced the couple husband and wife, they almost looked happy. 
  But I found myself thinking about how, in the face of eternity, our earthly 
  joys are as fleeting as a single beat of a butterfly´s wings. Life is cruelly 
  short. How long before the happy couple keeled over and died? If they were going 
  to go, I reflected, maybe it would be better for them to die now, while they 
  had the church booked. That way, the vicar could perform two ceremonies for 
  the price of one.<br>
  The wedding and the reception passed without fatalities. I eliminated the risk 
  of food poisoning by not eating. Instead, I consumed several glasses of beer. 
  In no time at all, I was feeling decidedly sanguine.<br>
  Then I noticed the father of the bride. His name is Colin. He´s a 55-year-old 
  company director who drives a Porsche Boxster, which should tell you all you 
  need to know. Colin was on the dance floor, shaking his creaky pelvis at a 17-year-old 
  bridesmaid. Now Colin is to dancing what Ghandi was to bodybuilding. Despite 
  his lack of coordination, he was having a marvelous time. This ruined my day. 
  There is nothing I hate more than the sight of stupid people enjoying themselves.<br>
  I didn´t try to enjoy myself on Sunday, the most depressing day of the week. 
  But on Monday, I went to a lovely restaurant in West London. I ordered an expensive 
  meal and was just about to enjoy myself when the film director Michael Winner 
  sat down at the next table. Needless to say, the mere sight of him put me off 
  my food so I had to leave.<br>
  On Thursday, I made a last-ditch attempt to celebrate being alive. My wife and 
  I spent the night in a luxurious hotel. We drank champagne and dined in the 
  hotel´s award-winning restaurant. At 11 o`clock we went to bed, only to be awoken 
  two hours later by the sound of two people enjoying themselves. Worse still, 
  they sounded like stupid people. Adding insult to injury, they seemed to be 
  enjoying themselves in our wardrobe. I opened the wardrobe door to investigate. 
  Then I realized that the noise was coming from the next door. Our stupid neighbors 
  continued to enjoy themselves stupidly until stupid daybreak.<br>
  By Friday, I was too tired to care about this column. I gave up trying to enjoy 
  myself. I poured myself a stiff drink and locked myself in my room and sulked 
  all day long. Funnily enough, I had the time of my life.</strong></p>
