"Woman. Everything I am I owe to Her. All the good and the bad in my life. All the sorcery and mystery. All the wisdom and madness. Even in the very beginning, before there could be space, or time either, when every point of each of us touched every point of each of the others, She was there. She was Herself the one point out of which everything has come. And She was the coming, too. Why do you think we left but to follow Her ?<br>
"In the very, very beginning, before there was a beginning, when everything was one point, Woman was all the incomprehensible meaning we needed. She held us together. She made us one. Wholly promiscuous, for we were all together with Her - yet wholly chaste, for She was as utterly alone as we were - one whole and single point. What greater happiness could there be ?<br>
"That was the question that doomed us. That we could think it at all bespeaks a terrible flaw in an otherwise perfect wholeness. But, of course, it was our perfection that inspired the question in the first place. How much happier could we be if we were to be a part of Her yet apart from Her ? How much more happiness would there be if we could see Her and be seen ?<br>
"And with that question came the necessity for the space to see and the time in which to be seen, the space a hug needs, the time a kiss requires, a space and a time vast enough to embrace all the mystery of Her and equally ample enough to make room for all of us that wanted to see and hold Her.<br>
"There were many more of us than any of us could have imagined. Each of us had thought we were the one and only one until we fell apart. Our clamoring for Her drove Her away from us - and naturally we followed, out into space and into time, wanting to be with Her as we have always been with Her. But in a new way. And so space and time came into being. Only none of us, except perhaps for Her, could have known how cold and dark it was going to be.<br>
"And none of us, surely not even She, could have anticipated the woe that was to follow - and the joy that woe would require to make itself whole again. And none suspected the sorcery and wisdom that we would have to learn and possess to match the mystery and madness of losing Her. Nor did we realize the vast distances, the expanding light-years of space and what great aeonian spans of time it would take even to begin to approximate the generous and true wholeness we had enjoyed when we were all at one point.<br>
"Little did any of us foresee our bizarre fate. How strange that, out here in space and time, each of us is so wholly separate from others. How strange that She is everywhere and yet nowhere. How much stranger yet that She has become woman - and out of womanÂ´s diminishment, out of the exile from the body of the ovaries to become testicles, out of the stunting of her nourishing breasts to useless nipples, out of the maiming of the fullness and symmetry of her chromosomes to a genetic mutation has come the distortion that is man.<br>
"Is there any wonder then that we men suffer and in our suffering we rage ? We are the immortal points that broke apart from the one point to follow Her here. We are the eternal wanderers. And where is She now ? She is everywhere and nowhere. She is the embrace of the great emptiness that is the universe. She is the long-lingering kiss of time. She is everything She always was - and everything we always wanted Her to be. Now we serve Her or we rail against Her, because we can never escape Her or ever really find Her. She is nameless and She is the very breath of all names - for She is the truth that finally embraces us all. She is God."<br>

The Dragon curls upon itself, listening to the dreamsongs that sift to earth out of the starry depths. The music from its other selves, from the Dragons of other worlds, is both fast and still, opening amorous joys in the liquid of its brain. Spellbound by this bliss, it wants to sing with the sweetness that comes from great strength, yet it lacks that power. And that lack is an estranging grief.<br>
Mind inwrought, the Dragon feels torn and alone. The dreamsongs strung on the starwinds curl directly through the desiring center of its need. The stars fall through the cold. The others are so far away. Somehow, it must reach them, must gather the force from its ragged limits so that it can sing loudly enough to share in the endless genesis of the Dragon.<br>
But for now it curls upon itself in its mortal circle, listening, yearning. The stars fall through the cold. The galaxies turn in their windy spirals. And the Dragon dreams of the first song, the first music of the Lords who set fire in the earth.</strong></div>
