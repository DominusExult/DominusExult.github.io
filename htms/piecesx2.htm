    <p><strong>Graham Joyce "REQUIEM":<br>
....<br>
What was it people were after with sex ? The answer wasn´t as obvious as it seemed. There were things beyond what the professional could offer: a prostitute can only take care of the need to sneeze. Then comes the yearning, the voracious hunger for the intimate moment of transcendence in another´s arms. That was exclusively, in the gift of one person to another. It could be simulated, but it could never be bought.<br>
It was natural magic, a human miracle. It was the thing religion had always tried to replicate and sustain, and the point at which religion had always failed. All religions. Everywhere.<br>
  The great Semitic religions had tried to replace it by defining the thing it 
  could never imitate as sinful and corrupting; they had tried to suppress it 
  by spelling out the destructive energies of its frightening magic.<br>
  It was simple: sex was diabolic in its origins, and, since men were defining 
  the terms, women made an easy shape for demons to squat in.<br>
Tom knew all about those demons and how they worked.<br>

"The veil of the false self is an earthly darkness; but the veil of the heart is the radiance of love !"<br>
....<br>
"This evening, before you came home,I dreamed of the Magdalene."<br>
"You too ? Are you sure it was a dream ?"<br>
"No. I´m not certain. I was dozing in the chair. I got up and she was there. I blinked my eyes and she was gone."<br>
"Was it a djinn ?"<br>
"Maybe. Perhaps it was something else pretending to be a djinn. I don´t know what a djinn is."<br>
"I´m beginning to."<br>
"Do you think it watches us in the dark ?"<br>
"Yes."<br>
"Do you think it watches us when we make love ? Was it watching us just now ?"<br>
"Yes. It crouches in the dark, and it watches. I don´t care anymore."<br>
"Ohhh ... When you kiss my belly like that ... Make love to me again. When you make love to me, the djinn can´t get inside me. I´m afraid of them getting inside me."<br>
"You´re not afraid of me being inside you ?"<br>
"Never. But I´m afraid of love getting inside me. I´m afraid of letting myself love you, Tom."<br>
"Is love a djinn ?"<br>
"Yes, I think it must be. Love is a djinn, crouching in the dark, waiting to get inside you."<br>
"No. The djinn is what comes when love is gone, when it´s seen enough."<br>
"You´re right. Love gets bored. Love gets tired. It wants to go somewhere else. But when it comes out it leaves a terrible hole, a gaping wound, bleeding, hollow. A place for djinn to live. That´s why I´m afraid of love. Don´t make me love you, Tom. Don´t make me do that."<br>

</strong><strong>Time and Friends<br>
Imagine there is a bank that credits your account each morning with $86,400. 
  It carries over no balance from day to day. Every evening the bank deletes whatever 
  part of the balance you failed to use during the day. What would you do? Draw 
  out every cent, of course !!!! Each of us has such a bank. Its name is TIME. 
  Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it writes off, 
  as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to good purpose. It carries 
  over no balance. It allows no overdraft. Each day it opens a new account for 
  you. Each night it burns the remains of the day. If you fail to use the day`s 
  deposits, the loss is yours. There is no going back. There is no drawing against 
  the "tomorrow". You must live in the present on today`s deposits. Invest it 
  so as to get from it the utmost in health, happiness and success! The clock 
  is running. Make the most of today. To realize the value of ONE YEAR, ask a 
  student who failed to grade. To realize the value of ONE MONTH, ask a mother 
  who gave birth to a premature baby. To realize the value of ONE WEEK, ask the 
  editor of a weekly newspaper. To realize the value of ONE HOUR, ask the lovers 
  who are waiting to meet. To realize the value of ONE MINUTE, ask a person who 
  missed the train. To realize the value of ONE SECOND, ask a person who just 
  avoided an accident. To realize the value of ONE MILLISECOND, ask the person 
  who won a silver medal in the Olympics. Treasure every moment that you have! 
  And treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough 
  to spend your time with. And remember that time waits for no one. Yesterday 
  is history. Tomorrow is a mysterie. Today is a gift. That`s why it`s called 
  the present!!! It`s National Friendship Week. Friends are a very rare jewel, 
  indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to succeed. They lend an ear, 
  they share a word of praise, and they always want to open their heart to us. 
  Show your friends how much you care. Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND. 
  If it comes back to you , then you`ll know you have circle of friends. HAPPY 
  FRIENDSHIP WEEK!!!!!!!!!<br>

<p><strong> ...Trolls, he thought. That´s what it was. Religious people believed God ran 
  the world. Atheists figured it was indifferent nature. But it was trolls. Sadistic 
  little homunculi in leather jackets with lots of zippers. Hiding behind the 
  scrim of being. Working the machinery to maximize human suffering for their 
  own amusement. Thumbing their noses, wagging their buds. He could almost hear 
  them laughing at him.<br>
  Yeah, and they were good, sweetheart. They were really good at their jobs. When 
  he´d crossed the bridge, when he reached the southern embankment, when he saw 
  Sophia there – the exquisite arrow of pain that went through him : it was a 
  masterpiece of natural cruelty. Fucking trolls.... </strong></p>
<p><strong>4 pages later...<br>
  He gathered her up again, felt her tense again, yield again, and kissed her 
  a long time, deeply. He was having an insight. An erection and an insight, both 
  profound. No, no, his insight was saying, no, no. Not trolls. You idiot. How 
  could you ever have thought it was trolls? This incredible, this resplendent 
  city; this cathedral in the mists of night; this bracing winter breeze, those 
  stars; this flesh, this flesh – this vehicle for bringing two souls together 
  at the mouth, at the loins: it´s the work of fucking Santa Claus.....</strong></p>

<p><strong> I think that people´s faces do express the lives they´ve led. People who´ve 
  done quite a lot in their lives have faces that show that. I´m not as old as 
  Hemmingway or Picasso were when they died. But I hope I´m on my way to getting 
  their kind of faces. You remember what Picasso was like? It´s something to do 
  with an appetite – with something alive.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who are you?<br>
Here on a high shelf<br>
In webbed flask I<br>
Hook up my folded self<br>
Bat-leather dry<br>
<br>
Who were you?<br>
The gold god goaded me<br>
Sang shrieking, sang high<br>
His heat corroded me<br>
Not mine his cry<br>
<br>
What do you see?<br>
I saw the firmament<br>
Steady the sky<br>
I saw the cerement<br>
Close Caesar´s eye<br>
<br>
What do you hope?<br>
Desire is a dowsed fire<br>
True love a lie<br>
To a dusty shelf we aspire<br>
I crave to die</strong></p>
