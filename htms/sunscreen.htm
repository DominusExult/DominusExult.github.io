    <h2><strong>&quot;Everybody's Free (to wear sunscreen)&quot;</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of '99. Wear Sunscreen </strong></p>
      <p><strong><big>If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen 
        would be it. The long term benefits of sunscreen have been provided by 
        scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than 
        my own meandering experience... I will dispense this advice now.</big> 
        </strong></p>
      <p><strong><big>Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you 
        will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have 
        faded. But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself 
        and recall in a way can grasp now how much possibility lay before you 
        and how fabulous you really looked... You're not as fat as you imagine.</big> 
        </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as
    effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. The real troubles
    in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind; the kind that
    blindside you at 4 pm on some idle Tuesday.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Do one thing everyday that scares you.</big> </strong></p>
    <h2><strong>Sing.</strong></h2>
    <p><strong><big>Don't be reckless with other people's hearts, don't put up with people who
    are reckless with yours.</big> </strong></p>
    <h2><strong>FLOSS.</strong></h2>
    <p><strong><big>Don't waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you're ahead, sometimes
    you're behind... the race is long, and in the end it's only with yourself.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults; if you succeed
    in doing this, tell me how.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.</big> </strong></p>
    <h2><strong>STRETCH.</strong></h2>
      <p><strong><big>Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with 
        your life... the most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what 
        they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year 
        olds I know still don't.</big> </strong></p>
    <h2><strong>GET PLENTY OF CALCIUM..</strong></h2>
    <p><strong><big>Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone.</big> </strong></p>
      <p><strong><big>Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't maybe you'll have children, 
        maybe you won't, maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky 
        chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary... what ever you do, don't congratulate 
        yourself too much or berate yourself either - your choices are half chance, 
        so are everybody else's.</big> </strong></p>
      <p><strong><big>Enjoy your body, use it every way you can... don't be afraid 
        of it, or what other people think of it, it's the greatest instrument 
        you'll ever own.</big> </strong></p>
      <p><strong><big>Dance... even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own 
        living room.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good. Be
    nice to your siblings; they are the best link to your past and the people most likely to
    stick with you in the future.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Understand that friends, come and go, but for the precious few you should
    hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography in lifestyle because the older you get,
    the more you need the people you knew when you were young.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard; live in
    Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.</big> </strong></p>
    <h2><strong>TRAVEL.</strong></h2>
    <p><strong><big>Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will
    philander, you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young
    prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Respect your elders.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund,
    maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Don't mess too much with your hair, or by time it's 40, it will look 85.</big>
    </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it.
    Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the
    disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more that it's
    worth.</big> </strong></p>
    <p><strong><big>BUT TRUST ME ON THE SUNSCREEN.</big> </strong></p>
