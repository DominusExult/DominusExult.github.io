    <strong><p>As you probably don´t know yet I´m Dominik and I was born in the magic 
    year 1976 under the zodiac sign of Taurus. I live near Stuttgart, Germany (in 
    fact I´m from the ZABERGÄU ) and ... what else ? I love to read, preferably 
    in English, in fact I normally &quot;consume&quot; about two books a week. Listening 
    to music is my second &quot;vice&quot;. I listen mostly to alternative music, 
    though I like many different styles as well....
    Bla, bla, bla... This information is about over a dozen years old (that long ago, the first incarnation of my
    homepage came to life).</p>
    <p>Anyway, I've been living in Vienna now for ages. Many many things happened since then...<br/>
	I'm the proud father of one girl and two sons, and living with my lovely love Eva!<br/>
    Yo, I think that´s it. Here are some pictures. For ease of use I have now put them up at the Picasa Web site. Enjoy them (don´t die 
    laughing looking at the 1st one). And yes, I know these are all old pictures and no new ones. But new ones will come, I PROMISE!!! Especially pictures of Mia are yet nowhere to be found here, sorry!</p>

    <p>Here you can find old pictures of me that went on my website some time ago.</p>

    <p><span class="Stil6">NOTE:</span> For some reason, Internet Explorer doesn't like those links to Picasa Web albums 
	    <span class="Stil6">IF</span> you are logged into a Google account that is not yet approved to publish on Picasa Web. I'm not quite sure what to do about 
	that since it works at least with Firefox.</p><br/>
	<p>Now that´s that. Right now I don´t have anymore photos. Can you imagine? Me neither and it's not true. I'm just a lazy b.... and haven't done anything with the site for YEARS and did not upload any pictures in a while. I'm trying to change that!</p>
	<p> Now let´s play that stupid Lonely-Island-Game. If I were stranded on a lonely island (which got electricity, a TV, VCR/DVD, CD-Player and all that stuff of course) I would like to have with me:</p>
	<p>5 Videos/DVDs:<ul>
	<li>Dead Man</li>
	<li>The Clerks</li>
  	<li>Star Wars Collection (I cheated)</li>
  	<li>Lost Highway</li>
	<li>Blood and Donuts</li></ul>
	Ha, Blood and Donuts... When I wrote that years ago, this movie must have made quite an impression. When I came back to this page years later... I had *NO* idea, what that movie is about. Strange...</p>
  	<p>5 CDs:<ul>
	<li>Hanin Elias - Future Noir </li> 
  	<li>Nine Inch Nails - Pretty Hate Machine </li>
  	<li>Seigmen - Metropolis</li> 
  	<li>Tobias Gruben - Die Erde</li>
  	<li>Systemhysterie - Liebeslieder und mehr </li>
  	</ul></strong>
    <p><strong>For real, look at all your CDs and ponder with which you would like 
	  to be all alone on an island, a strange collection that will be. Believe me!<br/>
	  For me the biggest problem was that I'd rather have five mix CDs with me than five one-band-only-CDs. 
	  I always had to make mixtapes or mixCDs, nowadays I just listen to my iPod/iPhone.</strong></p>
    <strong>
    <p> 5 Books:    
    <ul>
	  <li>Stephen King - The Dark Tower Collection (Cheated again, but it´s supposed to be one book)</li>
      <li>Dean R. Koontz - Tick Tock</li>
      <li>John Irving - The world according to Garp</li>
      <li>Frank Herbert - Dune  (preferably all)</li>
      <li>Patricia Cornwell - Hornet´s Nest</li>
    </ul>
    can´t I take all my books ? Please ! That´s even worse than choosing the CDs.
    </p>
This book list needs serious attention, I'm not sure I can leave it at that. </strong>
