    <p><strong>"Saskia"<br>
That night I dream of Saskia and when I wake up in the morning the events of last night´s reading in the club and my dream are all mixed up together. It takes the first coffee of the morning for me to sort them all out.<br>

<p><strong>"My Life As A Bird"<br>
    <i>Mona´s Monologue From Chapter Three:</i><br>
  The thing is, we spend too much time looking outside ourselves for what we should 
  really be trying to find inside. But we can´t seem to trust what we find in 
  ourselves - maybe because that´s where we find it. I suppose it´s all part of 
  how we ignore who we really are. We´re so quick to cut away pieces of ourselves 
  to suit a particular relationship, a job, a circle of friends, incessantly editing 
  who we are until we fit in. Or we do it to someone else. We try to edit the 
  people around us.<br>
I don´t know which is worse.<br>
Most people would say it´s when we do it to someone else, but I don´t think either one´s a very healthy option.<br>
  Why do we love ourselves so little? Why are we suspect for trying to love ourselves, 
  for being true to who and what we are rather than what someone else thinks we 
  should be? We´re so ready to betray ourselves, but we never call it that. We 
  have all these other terms to describe it: Fitting in. Doing the right thing. 
  Getting along.<br>
I´m not proposing a world solely ruled by rank self-interest; I know that there have to be some limits of politeness and compromise or all we´ll have left is anarchy. And anyone who expects the entire world to adjust to them is obviously a little to full of their own self-importance.<br>
But how can we expect others to respect or care for us, if we don´t respect and care for ourselves? And how come no one asks, " If you´re so ready to betray yourself, why should I believe that you won´t betray me as well?"<br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Mona´s Monologue From Chapter Eight:</i><br>
  Sometimes I think of God as this little man sitting on a café patio somewhere, 
  bewildered at how it´s all gotten so out of his control. He had such good intentions, 
  but everything he made had a mind of its own and, right from the first, he found 
  himself unable to contain their conflicting impulses. He tried to create paradise, 
  but he soon discovered that free will and paradise were incompatible because 
  everybody has a different idea as to what paradise should be like.<br>
  But usually when I think of him, I think of a cat: a little mysterious, a little 
  aloof, never coming when he´s called. And in my mind, God´s always a he. The 
  bible makes it pretty clear that men are the doers; women can only be virgins 
  or whores. In God´s eyes, we can only exist somewhere in between the two Marys, 
  the mother of Jesus and the Magdalene.<br>
  What kind of religion is that? What kind of religion ignores the rights of half 
  the world´s population just because they´re supposed to have envy instead of 
  a penis? One run by men. The strong, the brave, the true. The old boys` club 
  that wrote the book and made the laws.<br>
  I´d like to find him and ask him, "Is that it, God? Did we really get cloned 
  from a rib and because we´re hand-me-downs, you don´t think we´ve got what it 
  takes to be strong and brave and true?"<br>
  But that´s only part of what´s wrong with the world. You also have to ask, what´s 
  the rationale behind wars and sickness and suffering?<br>
  Or is there no point? Is God just as bewildered as the rest of us? Has he finally 
  given, spending his days now on that café patio, sipping strong espresso, and 
  watching the world go by, none of it his concern anymore? Has he washed his 
  hands of it all?<br>
  I´ve got a thousand questions for God, but he never answers any of them. Maybe 
  he´s still trying to figure out where I fit on the scale between the two Marys 
  and he can´t reply until he does. Maybe he doesn´t hear me, doesn´t see me, 
  doesn´t think of me at all. Maybe in his version of what the world is, I don´t 
  even exist.<br>
  Or if he´s a cat, then I´m a bird, and he´s just waiting to pounce.<br>
  <br>
"Trader"<br>
"Nothing´s free in this world except leftovers and friendship and even friendship 
  costs. The difference is, usually we don´t mind paying the coin it requires."</strong><br>
