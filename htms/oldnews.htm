<p>31.10.2001 okay the pictures are online. Look at 'Me&amp;Myself'.</p>
<hr color="#808080" size="4" width="40%">
<p>23.10.2001 hehehe. Wow, that was a pretty long time that I didn&acute;t 
  update these pages. I won&acute;t promise that I update more often cause I tend 
  not to keep that promise.<br>
  And again, I have to say that there is someone new in my life. Actually this 
  time there are two of them. Not what you think now. My new girlfriend, Ruth, 
  has got a four-year-old daughter, Leah, and I spent a lot of time with them. 
  I like them a lot and they seem to like me no less, so I&acute;m quite happy 
  now. We&acute;ve met at Easter Sunday this year so we&acute;ve been together 
  for over half a year now and it doesn&acute;t look like that will change :-) 
  Actually Ruth was a little mad with me that my homepage still mentioned Connie 
  as my girlfriend so that had to change before my laziness gets me into too much 
  trouble. Photos of our little family will be put up here in the next two weeks 
  (hopefully). My plans for relocating to Berlin changed obviously when I met 
  Ruth :-)</p>
<p><br>
  Otherwise I&acute;m as always busy with studying. Apart from that I&acute;m 
  really busy with an Open Source project called <a href="http://exult.sourceforge.net">Exult</a> since the end of last year. It&acute;s a project which aims at getting the best 
  RPG ever (IMO) playable on most computer platforms. In this team I&acute;m responsible 
  for maintaining the documentation and the FAQ (frequently asked questions) as 
  well as alpha/betatesting the game.<br>
  </p>
<p>You may have noticed that the layout of my homepage changed a bit. Hope 
  you like it but some areas are going to change some more when I find the time 
  and/or when I put up the pictures of Ruth, Leah and me. The background music 
  changed again and the offer from last year still stands as no one got the name 
  of the band or even the title right. This time its even more difficult :-)<br>
  </p>
<hr color="#808080" size="4" width="40%">
<p>19.05.2000 Phew, it&acute;s been awhile... But I had a lot to do (don&acute;t 
  ask me what - I wouldn&acute;t know :))<br>
  Got myself a new girlfriend (Conny - if you look you&acute;ll find a picture 
  or two here). Been to Maui in February, visiting my mom, last weekend I visited 
  London with Andi, some friends were over from Germany to celebrate my birthday, 
  My Mom visited for the same reason and so on...<br>
  I did a lot on the pages though it doesn&acute;t look so at first. Made a lot 
  of the pictures smaller, added a bunch more (of USA and my birthday). Deleted 
  a page (guess which).<br>
  Added a new background song as some complained about the old one. Now there&acute;s 
  a prize to win : Tell me from who did the original and the name of the song. 
  The prize is of course a weekend here in Vienna with me... :)</p>
<hr color="#808080" size="4" width="40%">
<p>09.01.2000 :) I told you...&nbsp;<br>
  Bummer... the new millennium arrived and the world still exists. You see, nothing 
  new. Well, as to my life there&acute;s also nothing terrible new and exciting. 
  Not that nothing happens but it&acute;s too much and too uninteresting to write 
  about... :)<br>
  The only thing I did with these pages are some new photos in my pictures page.<br>
  03.10.99 Oh Yeah. Seems like I&acute;m not able to update more than once in 
  quarter year. Beats me why. Whatever, now I live in Vienna, Austria and tomorrow 
  university starts. Since the last update happened too many things to write them 
  down. I have been to some Open-air Festivals (the Southside/Munich and Bizarre/Cologne) 
  and these were very interesting (and I don&acute;t mean only the bands :-)). 
  Jutta came back from the US and in the last couple of days things changed a 
  little bit. Only a little, whatever that means now, I certainly don&acute;t 
  know it.<br>
  The news on these pages aren&acute;t much but I scanned some pictures from my 
  party. Not much else. Sorry !!!<br>
  See you in three months</p>
<hr color="#808080" size="4" width="40%">
<p><br>
  06.07.99 Das Leben mu&szlig; weiter gehen - ein bi&szlig;chen heute, ein bi&szlig;chen 
  mehr morgen. Wow, so much happened and it&acute;s so long ago I did anything 
  on these pages. I&acute;m still alive, first of all. Eventually I did spent 
  some more time with my babe which was all in vain as she is no longer my babe. 
  Yep, you guessed right, she broke up with me. From the middle of April I wasted 
  another six weeks in the US, visiting Jutta in LA , spending some time with 
  John shooting parts of a No-Budget-Movie in Denver, paying a short visit to 
  Corey in Calgary. Two weeks after my return She broke up. And that&acute;s that. 
  So it goes. I may sound cool but I don&acute;t know how I am.<br>
  Meanwhile I&acute;m looking for a place in Vienna. Great City !!!<br>
  What I did to the pages? Got rid of all the Java shit. These damn aplets just 
  use up to much of precious download time and I still heard of some who don&acute;t 
  have an Java-compliant browser. I also added some more Bits and Pieces, including 
  Frank Herbert (author of the Dune-Series) and some more smaller stuff. I added 
  some more of my own written stuff - go find it. And I added the <a href="sunscreen.htm">Sunscreen-Page</a> (this is the only link to it). You may have heard this song or seen the video. 
  Great text. Some more smaller changes to my Pictures-Section and some other 
  minor ones. A lot to read but I hope you don&acute;t mind. Soon I will add some 
  more pictures. But most of you know what soon means to me.<br>
  </p>
<hr color="#808080" size="4" width="40%">

<p>18.03.99 Puh !!! Some major updates... Where to start now? Okay, I visited 
  Jutta in LA and from my view we had a great time there. For the first time in 
  my life I had to put up with horses, which in the end wasn&acute;t bad at all 
  and I just enjoyed being with Jutta and we even planned to extend my stay and 
  to visit my mum on Maui... but then both disaster and fortune struck. Martina 
  called me that the university of VIENNA accepted me and that I have to come 
  back home immediately to register there. I did thus I am a student now. Yub 
  yub !!! But I wanted to spend some more time with my babe....<br>
  Anyway, as requested I put some pictures of Jutta up to look at them chose Me&amp;Myself 
  on the left frame or just click here.<br>
  A little update to the Bits and Pieces and as always some small looks updates. 
  I still have to transcribe a lot and I didn&acute;t take time for this the last 
  months... But at one point it will be done... If in doubt you can always blame 
  the game ZELDA for the lack of updates. It just keeps me on the hook...<br>
  Love you all<br>
  Dom<br>

<p>05.01.99 Happy new one to everyone. How was your New Year&acute;s Eve ? 
  Don&acute;t know what to think of mine, as Jutta left. We celebrated together 
  and that&acute;s worth a lot at least. And before I start babbling I&acute;ll 
  just tell you that finally I updated my picture section. Go and see for yourself. 
  That&acute;s it for now.<br>
  </p>
<hr color="#808080" size="4" width="40%">

<p>28.12.98 Haven´t seen in ages, have we? I
was busy, sorry. Busy ? With what, you may ask. You know, there is a new song in my life
and I was busy listening to this wonderful tune. The name of this song is Jutta and we had
a great time together, these last weeks. Unfortunately she´s going to California on the
1st and will be staying there for half a year. Easy come, easy go. Worse things happen, at
least that´s what I tell myself right now, in fact I don´t know anything worse.</p>
  <p>I also didn´t update the site because I
was too damn lazy to transcribe anything. Now I did and I made some changes as well. Just
look at everything. I´m still working on the new pictures. A friend (Andi H.) is scanning
them right now and they will be up at the end of the week. I hope to add a picture of
Jutta, as well. We´ll see.</p>

<p>And maybe this site is a goner anyway. Too
many people look at my pages, I definitly don´t want to. So the next update will be
somewhere else. Or maybe, when I think of it, I ´ll start with this one.</p>

<hr color="#808080" size="4" width="40%">

<p>29.11.98 At last some news. As I hinted I
was in New York for about a week and when I was back I haven´t found the time to update
the pages. I finished a good book (&quot;The Golden Key&quot;, by Melanie Rawn &amp;
Jennifer Roberson &amp; Kate Elliott) saw a lot of movies (e.g. &quot;Truman Show&quot;
&lt;- not bad, but they should have done more with this idea...) and of course I was
shopping... When I was back I went with my sister Martina and her friend Kai (by the way
he and a friend, Alex, were &quot;Ali &amp; Mehmet&quot; in the <a href="../guestlog.htm">Guestbook</a>,
Alex tried again as &quot;Bernd Uhse&quot; - I had to give that away... :-)) to the ASH -
Concert in Stuttgart. `Twas rather disappointing, I expected a better show. Well,
whatever, nevermind.</p>

<p>I hate the weather here, in NY it was very
warm, here in Germany it´s fucking cold (not just cold or very cold). On sunday we had a
long walk in Central Park with Brooke, a friend of my mother and it was very nice.</p>

<p>I didn´t add new text to the site. Just
made a couple of changes to the graphics. I hope I reduced the loading time as well, for
at least a little bit. Sorry I just can´t part from the sounds. Next time I hope to add
some pics to <a href="myself.htm">Me&amp;Myself</a> but then I will have to reorganize
this section. We´ll see about that.</p>

<p>I´m always curios and glad to see who
made an entry in my <a href="../guestlog.htm">Guestbook</a></p>

<hr color="#808080" size="4" width="40%">

<p>16.11.98 Long time no see, huh? What happened in those six days ? A lot
and not always pleasant things. On tuesday (10.11.) night I met the girl I´m still in
love with at the Waldhaus (a Disco) and that may sound good to you, but you have to know
that she´s not in love with me, and that I know for fact. On saturday I helped with an
IMAX-Production. Now that sounds boasting, I know, but it´s a trailer for the
IMAX-Theatres in Sinsheim and Speyer. We filmed the &quot;Cars&amp;Stars&quot;-Show from
Mercedes in Stuttgart. The Formula 1 winner Häkkinen was supposed to do some laps with
the Silberpfeil (he didn´t ´cause he partied to much the night before, so a Formula 3000
pilot drove the Silver Arrow). We had to get up at 3:30 a.m. and spent the whole day in
the open. That means I don´t remember feeling so cold before, at the end of the day I
didn´t feel my feet anymore... So that were the things worth mentioning.</p>

<p>I updated the site a bit. Corrected some spelling mistakes some people
pointed out. Thanks!!! There´s the new section <a href="prolog.htm">Ramblings</a> in
which I´ll write stupid things. So don´t bother unless you want your mind twisted :-).
The sounds are smaller and fewer but in a worse quality. It´s quality versus loadtime. By
the way, some have reported that they are not able to hear a bloody tune. Am I Jesus ? Auf
Einzelschicksale kann keine Rücksicht genommen werden. I´m able to hear´em, other can
hear´em, so there´s probably nothing wrong on my side of the line.</p>

<p>AOL explained to me that they are switching servers (hopefully to better
ones), that explains perhaps why my site has sometimes been inaccessible. If you are
unable to connect just try again another time.</p>

<p>Probably I´m updating the <a href="pieces.htm">Bits&amp;Pieces</a> page
as well, look at the end.</p>

<p>Most likely this will be the last update for more than a week. I´ll be
visiting the other side of the atlantic soon.... See you</p>

<hr color="#808080" size="4" width="40%">

<p>10.11.98 Sometimes the site is not accessible. Don´t always know why.
Sometimes I just don´t know why I put up with AOL. At other times it´s just too
convenient not to use it. </p>

<p>Now at last there´s the Comic, and two more pictures in Me&amp;Myself. <a
href="religions.htm">The Religions of the World</a> page has been added. Links are updated
as well. Have fun.</p>

<p>I added a Midi-File. The song Stones as known from the Ultima-Game-Series.
It´s playing continuosly. If it gets on your nerves just hit the Stop-button of your
browser. I hope you are able to hear sounds. Some more sounds were added. Doesn´t play
correctly all the time.</p>

<p>Before I forget it my mother requested something by Sartre. Here we go :
&quot;Die Hölle, das sind die anderen.&quot;</p>

<hr color="#808080" size="4" width="40%">

<p>08.11.98 Guestbook available and working. My sister wasn´t able to connect, using
Netscape Navigator. What now ? Besides the frame there´s nothing peculiar on my site.
Easy come, easy go, wait and see. I´m going to update a lot. As fast as I am able to
transcribe my notes to my Computer....</p>
